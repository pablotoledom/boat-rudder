This project aims to implement a solution that facilitates the creation of websites for obsolete browsers, such as:

    Netscape Navigator 2
    Opera
    Internet Explorer 4
    Other browsers compatible with ECMAScript 2 and later.

To facilitate the construction of websites, the goal is to prioritize modularity and the creation of a design system, with basic form components and a prototype based on minimalism. To achieve this, the use of JavaScript and loading of polyfills will be limited as much as possible in order to save the maximum amount of RAM in the browsers.

It is understood that browsers from the early 1990s were in an era of experimentation, so there is a significant lack of standards. Therefore, the best solution for resource savings will likely be server-side rendering.
