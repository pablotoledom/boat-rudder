# Boat Rudder CMS

Boat Rudder is a modular Content Management System (CMS) written in C, designed to support a wide range of browsers with backwards compatibility through epochs. The CMS organizes its components efficiently to deliver dynamic content such as blogs and home pages with customizable themes and language support.

## Features

- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - **Epoch 1 (Early):** Basic HTML templates for older browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator 3.0, Internet Explorer 4.0).
  - **Epoch 2 (Middle):** CSS1/CSS2 templates for mid-era browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer 6.0, Firefox 1.0).
  - **Epoch 3 (Modern):** HTML5 and CSS3 templates for modern browsers (e.g., Google Chrome 90+, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox 90+).
- **Dynamic Content Management:** Blog and homepage content generated dynamically from APIs and databases.
- **Theming:** Supports both dark and light themes.
- **Language Support:** Multilingual capabilities (English and Spanish).
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Fetches content directly from Google Sheets API.

## Architecture Overview
